### Contributing

Clone the repository by running:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:ccabo1/muse-consulting-website.git
```
Once this is completed, make sure your packages are up to date and configured:
```
$ npm install
```
To get to work, run:
```
$ gulp
```
Keep running this while you edit the `scss` files in the `scss` folder. Gulp will automatically compile the `scss` on save into minified `css` files in the `css` folder. If there are any errors with compilation, they will come up in the terminal window running gulp.
